DataSource Module
=================

The DataSource module is crucial for database management within the application. This module provides an abstraction layer that allows handling the connection to the database and the initial configuration of the tables necessary for the operation of the application. Its primary goal is to ensure that all interactions with the database are secure, efficient, and handled consistently.
